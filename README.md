# About the Project

MyFoodies is a responsive web application inspired to make it easier for people to create a grocery list that can be shared with friends and family

It has also been designed to allow the user to add the items bought from the list to their virtual pantry and track its inventory.

In future, I plan to include the recipe and profile features, for people to update their profile information, and add their personal recipes and check which recipes they can do with the ingredients they have in their virtual pantry.

If you are interested in the project or would like to discuss any feature you would like to see in this project, feel free to reach me out!
